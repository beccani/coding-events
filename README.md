# coding-events

This application is meant to allow the user the compile a list of events with their corresponding details.
The user is able to :
  - create and delete events
  - create and delete event categories
  - create and delete tags
  - "tag" events with certain key words that are related to the event
  
 The app is currently using bootstrap for the CSS and could use improvement.  There is no functionality to edit events once they are created. 
 
 For further functionality, a "Person" class could be added. This would require a new Person repository, model and controller as  well as some new templates for the view. You would also need to establish a one to many relationship between the Person and the Events class.
